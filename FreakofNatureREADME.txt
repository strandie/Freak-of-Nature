Game Pitch: Hop around as a frog and vault around enemies! Make sure to light up the lamps to see better in the environment!
How to Play: The controls are WASD to move around, use the mouse cursor the move the camera, then hold right click to vault off the ground. Press left click to shoot a fireball!

Amount & Type of Content Available: There's one map to move around in, and a centipede enemy + trees + three lamps to interact with. Make sure to hit the lamps to also increase the light level!
Lessons Learned: The game is much different than our proposed document, which goes to show how much we underestimated the scope of the project. It's also tough doing animation + assets on the side as well!
